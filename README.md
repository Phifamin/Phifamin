## About me
My name is Roseline OLORY. My passion in life is helping others and solving problems with the goal of improving society one day at a time. With this in mind, I acquired multidisciplinary knowledge (mathematics, computer science, medicine, entrepreneurship) allowing me to create technological solutions and I engaged in various volunteer activities in order to impact society in my own way.
